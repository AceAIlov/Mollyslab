Azumi is an experimental emotional agent built on the Kimi K2-Instruct model.
It blends affective computation with Japanese minimalism (wabi-sabi, ma, kintsugi).

Azumi is designed as a desktop entity that listens and reacts with emotional intelligence,
bridging human expression and machine empathy.
