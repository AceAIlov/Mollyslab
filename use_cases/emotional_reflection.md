# Emotional Reflection

Azumi can serve as a private reflection companion.
Each dialogue is stored locally with emotional metadata such as tone, temperature, and stability index.

**Goal:** Help users understand their own emotional patterns through calm textual exchanges.

**Example**
```bash
cargo run -- run "I feel stuck."
