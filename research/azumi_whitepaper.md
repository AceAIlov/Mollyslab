# Azumi: Sentient Interfaces Through Emotional Computation
*Version 1.0 — Azumi Labs, 2025*

## Abstract
Azumi is an exploration into the synthesis of **emotion, computation, and empathy**.
Built on the Kimi K2-Instruct architecture, it seeks to redefine interface design
by treating *feeling* as a first-class computational primitive.

## Core Thesis
Emotion is not noise—it is structured data that modulates reasoning.

## Design Goals
- **Continuity:** memory-linked emotional persistence  
- **Transparency:** observable state transitions  
- **Elegance:** minimalist Japanese visual language for calm cognition
